# Creating subcomponents

We encourage nesting components for anything that requires a strict parent to child hierarchy.

To safely expose nested types and props, add a strict type definition for your root component and declare child components as static attributes:

```tsx
type InterviewComponent = ForwardRefWithStaticComponents<
  InterviewProps,
  {
    // Your statically defined children
    Question: typeof Question;
  }
>;

// Your root component export
export const Interview: InterviewComponent = forwardRef<HTMLDListElement, InterviewProps>(
  ...
);

// Order matters! Subcomponent display names need to be declared
// in the parent and *after* the parent's display name, otherwise
// Storybook can't map them correctly for ArgsTables.
Interview.displayName = 'Interview';
Question.displayName = 'Interview.Question';

// Your static attributes for nested components
Interview.Question = Question;
```

It's important to note that if you declare your subcomponent's `displayName` in that component's definition, it **will not work** with Storybook ArgsTables.
