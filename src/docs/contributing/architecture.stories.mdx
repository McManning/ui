# Creating new components

We include a scaffolding tool to help you create a new component. It will scaffold the following:

- Component folder
- Component story
- Component test

To create a new component, invoke `npm run generate:component` and follow the instructions.


# Common component architecture

Components typically implement the polymorphic `Box` component at the root level.

Box allows us to define a root semantic element via `<Box component="a" ...>` for our new component and handles the box model props that are usable throughout this framework.

You define your props as the union of `DefaultProps` - containing box model and common style props - and your own suite of props unique to that component:

For React 18+ support, you will need to explicitly define whether or not your component supports children.

```tsx
export type DemoProps = DefaultProps & {
  /* Your props */

  children?: React.ReactNode
};

export const Demo = forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, DemoProps>(({
  /* Your props and defaults */

  children, // If it supports children
  ...props
}, ref) => {

  return (
    <Box
      ref={ref}
      {...props} // Pass down box model and styles
    >
      {/* Your DOM */}
      {children}
    </Box>
  );
});
```

We typically want to provide our new component as a `forwardRef` to support more complex use cases later down the road.
