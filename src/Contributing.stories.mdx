# Creating new components

We include a scaffolding tool to help you create a new component. It will scaffold the following:

- Component folder
- Component story
- Component test

To create a new component, invoke `npm run generate:component` and follow the instructions.

## Common component architecture

Components typically implement the polymorphic `Box` component at the root level.

Box allows us to define a root semantic element via `<Box component="a" ...>` for our new component and handles the box model props that are usable throughout this framework.

You define your props as the union of `DefaultProps` - containing box model and common style props - and your own suite of props unique to that component:

For React 18+ support, you will need to explicitly define whether or not your component supports children.

```tsx
export type DemoProps = DefaultProps & {
  /* Your props */

  children?: React.ReactNode
};

export const Demo = forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, DemoProps>(({
  /* Your props and defaults */

  children, // If it supports children
  ...props
}, ref) => {

  return (
    <Box
      ref={ref}
      {...props} // Pass down box model and styles
    >
      {/* Your DOM */}
      {children}
    </Box>
  );
});
```

We typically want to provide our new component as a `forwardRef` to support more complex use cases later down the road.

## Making polymorphic components

If you're building a component that you know needs to expose a polymorphic root element - such as a button that could also be an anchor - you will want to follow the below pattern:


```tsx
export type PolymorphicDemoProps = DefaultProps & {
  /* Your props */

  children?: React.ReactNode
};

export const _PolymorphicDemo = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, PolymorphicDemoProps & { component: any }>(({
  /* Your props and defaults */

  children, // If it supports children
  component = 'button',
  ...props
}, ref) => (
  <Box
    component={component}
    ref={ref}
    {...props} // Pass down box model and styles
  >
    {/* Your DOM */}
    {children}
  </Box>
));

/**
 * Documentation about your component goes *here* for Storybook to parse it
 */
export const PolymorphicDemo = createPolymorphicComponent<'button', PolymorphicDemoProps>(
  _PolymorphicDemo
);
```

Tips:

- Always provide a default for the `component` prop
- In the `forwardRef` template arguments, you will need to union `{ component: any }` into your prop types.
