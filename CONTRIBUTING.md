Run `npm start` to boot up Styleguidist and develop locally. As you make changes to component code and examples, Styleguidist will rebuild your changes live.

Make sure all your components and changes are fully documented (Prop Types documentation, associated `readme.md` filled with examples, notes added to `CHANGELOG.md`).

Once your changes are ready to be used in an external application, run `npm run build` to generate an updated deployable of Styleguidist and ES5 components for usage through node_modules.
