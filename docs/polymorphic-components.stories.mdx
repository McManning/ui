# Polymorphic Components

Some of our components, such as `Button` and `Text`, accept an `as` prop that allows you to
change the root element. This guide will explain how to correctly use them
with HTML elements, custom components, and TypeScript.

If you are not familiar with the concept of polymorphic components, check out this tutorial from freeCodeCamp:

[Intermediate TypeScript and React Handbook - How to Build Strongly Typed Polymorphic Components](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-with-react-and-typescript/)

## As HTML elements

You can use any HTML element in the `as` prop, for example the `a` tag will render an anchor:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@osuresearch/ui';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <Button as="a" href="https://research.osu.edu">
      Go to research.osu.edu
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## As other components

You can also polymorph into any other component. For example, with the `react-router-dom` Link:

```tsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Button } from '@osuresearch/ui';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <Button component={Link} to="/react-router">
      React router link
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Why use polymorphics

Often you will want to use specific components that visually or interactively match your design but the root component is not semantically allowed for accessibility.

Take for example a card with a button that links the user to another website:

<Paper withBorder bgc="light" p="md" w={220}>
  <Text as="p" pb="md">
    Some blurb here!
  </Text>

  <Button as="a" variant="primary" href="https://research.osu.edu" target="_blank">
    Visit research.osu.edu
  </Button>
</Paper>

We want it to visually look like a button, but semantically it has to be an anchor to be WCAG compliant.

## TypeScript edge cases

In some cases, polymorphic components cannot infer ref and events correctly. When this happens, specify the component type in the generic form:

```tsx
<Box<'button'>
  as="button"
  onClick={(event) => console.log(event)}
  ref={(node) => console.log(node)}
  {...args}
>
  button element
</Box>
```

## Create your own polymorphic components

We provide a utility to allow you to construct your own polymorphic components.

Typically, this involves wrapping a `<Box>` component and passing down your polymorphic element value.

```tsx
type ButtonProps = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export const Button = polymorphicForwardRef<'button', ButtonProps>(({ as, children, ...props }, ref) => (
  <Box as={as || 'button'}>
    {children}
  </Box>
));
```

>For RUI maintainers: Tag all polymorphic components with `@ruiPolymorphic`
