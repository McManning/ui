This is a living styleguide of React components for use in ORIS applications. Code samples for each component are interactive and can be modified live from within your browser.


## Accessibility Standards

All components are built with accessibility in mind, but how they are utilized within a web application requires additional care to meet modern accessibility standards. Many components will contain additional documentation about accessibility and acceptable usage within applications.

Contact the ERIK Digital Accessibility Coordinator at ERIK-Accessibility@osu.edu if you have questions or find an accessibility bug.
