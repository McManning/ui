# @osuresearch/ui

Research UI is The Ohio State University's Office of Research component library, based on
Ohio State's design system - BUX.

Version 5 is a complete ground-up rework of the framework with a focus on:

- Brand alignment with BUX
- Accessibility-first components
- Full TypeScript compatibility
- Larger suite of atomic components

And other rants here. I'll think of good wordy bits later.


UI designs and documentation can be found for most components at [wherever-this-storybook-is-hosted](#).

## Installation instructions

```
npm i @osuresearch/ui
```

## Start using the library

```tsx
import { Button } from '@osuresearch/ui';
...

render() {
  return (
    <Button>Hello world!</Button>
  )
}
```
