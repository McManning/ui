# Ohio State Research UI

Research UI is The Ohio State University's Office of Research component library, based on
Ohio State's design system - BUX.

Version 5 is a complete ground-up rework of the framework with a focus on:

- Brand alignment with BUX
- Accessibility-first components
- Full TypeScript compatibility
- Larger suite of atomic components

And other rants here. I'll think of good wordy bits later.


UI designs and documentation can be found for most components at [https://osuresearch.github.io/ui/](https://osuresearch.github.io/ui/)
