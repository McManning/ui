# Research UI

Research UI is The Ohio State University's Office of Research component library, based on
Ohio State's design system - BUX.

Version 5 is a complete ground-up rework of the framework with a focus on:

<Card
  headline="This is a card without an image"
  href="https://example.com"
  variant="panel"
>
  Script Ohio tbdbitl non magna quis tortor volutpat flow of ideas The Lantern vestibulum ligula efficitur Woody Hayes highest-ranked public university in Ohio.
</Card>

- Brand alignment with BUX
- Accessibility-first components
- Full TypeScript compatibility
- Larger suite of atomic components

And other rants here. I'll think of good wordy bits later.
