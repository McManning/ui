# Making polymorphic components

If you're building a component that you know needs to expose a polymorphic root element - such as a button that could also be an anchor - you will want to follow the below pattern:


```tsx
export type PolymorphicDemoProps = DefaultProps & {
  /* Your props */

  children?: React.ReactNode
};

export const _PolymorphicDemo = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, PolymorphicDemoProps & { component: any }>(({
  /* Your props and defaults */

  children, // If it supports children
  component = 'button',
  ...props
}, ref) => (
  <Box
    component={component} // Pass down the semantic element
    ref={ref}
    {...props} // Pass down box model and styles
  >
    {/* Your DOM */}
    {children}
  </Box>
));

/**
 * Documentation about your component goes *here* for Storybook to parse it
 */
export const PolymorphicDemo = createPolymorphicComponent<'button', PolymorphicDemoProps>(
  _PolymorphicDemo
);
```

### Additional Guidelines

- You **should** provide a default for the `component` prop, otherwise `div` will be assumed.
- In the `forwardRef` template arguments, you **must** union `{ component: any }` into your prop types.
- Components with semantic a11y meaning **must not** be polymorphic.
  - Example: The `<Title>` component must semantically be an `<h1>` through `<h4>` element.
- **DO** document that your component is polymorphic in the source file docs and add examples of why someone would use it as a polymorph. See the `Title` component for an example.
