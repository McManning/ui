# Style System

Notes here about RUI's style system. How it works, what props mean, a reference maybe, etc.

Key points to touch on:

- Theme-dependent color. E.g. `c={{ dark: 'violet', light: 'blue' }}`
- Screen-dependent space. E.g. `m={{ xs: 'sm', md: 'lg', xl: 'xl' }}`
- Group and Stack composition (+ future container or grid things)
- CSS independence - RUI does not control global CSS styles (except for Tailwind's reset). All styles are encapsulated into components. Meaning no implicit styling with `<strong>`, `<p>`, etc.



## Responsive Properties

Many components in Research UI support an object syntax for props that specify a different value depending on the responsive breakpoint.

Research UI's breakpoints are mobile first: responsive props apply at that breakpoint and above. For example, the `xl` breakpoint is applied at screen sizes 1280px and wider.
