# Style System

Notes here about RUI's style system. How it works, what props mean, a reference maybe, etc.

Key points to touch on:

- Theme-dependent color. E.g. `c={{ dark: 'violet', light: 'blue' }}`
- Screen-dependent space. E.g. `m={{ xs: 'sm', md: 'lg', xl: 'xl' }}`
- Group and Stack composition (+ future container or grid things)
- CSS independence - RUI does not control global CSS styles (except for Tailwind's reset). All styles are encapsulated into components. Meaning no implicit styling with `<strong>`, `<p>`, etc.

Many components in Research UI are built on top of a set of style system properties that allow you to set the margins, padding, colors, and other standard styles on each component. 

## Spacing

Each component has properties to modify spacing:

|Prop|CSS Equivalent||Prop|CSS Equivalent
|---|---|---|---|---
|m|<code>margin: N N N N</code>||p|<code>padding: N N N N</code>
|mt|<code>margin-top: N</code>||pt|<code>padding-top: N</code>
|mb|<code>margin-bottom: N</code>||pb|<code>padding-bottom: N</code>
|mr|<code>margin-right: N</code>||pr|<code>padding-right: N</code>
|ml|<code>margin-left: N</code>||pl|<code>padding-left: N</code>
|mx|<code>margin: 0 N</code>||px|<code>padding: 0 N</code>
|my|<code>margin: N 0</code>||py|<code>padding: N 0</code>

Property values in the style system are based on T-shirt sizes `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl` to enforce standard spacing values between components.

## Colors

Each component has properties to modify colors:

|Prop|CSS Equivalent
|---|---
|c|<code>color: N</code>
|bgc|<code>background-color: N</code>

These properties only accept colors from our palette, such as `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `teal` and so forth.

Make sure that when you are picking a color that the contrasting color meetings WCAG AA contrast requirements in both light and dark mode. Most theme colors come with a ready to use contrast value, such as `primary-contrast` or `success-contrast`. 

## Responsive Properties

Many components in Research UI support an object syntax for props that specify a different value depending on the responsive breakpoint. All spacing, sizing, and color props support responsive values.

If you wanted to reduce the padding and font size of a component for smaller screens, you can do the following:

```tsx
<Text as="p" pb={{ md: 'xs', lg: 'md' }} fs={{ md: 'sm', lg: 'base' }}> 
  Brimming with traditions as a community, we empower people and their potential
</Text>
```

Resize your window to see the responsive font and padding changes:

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>
  <Card withBorder>
    <Text as="p" pb={{ md: 'xs', lg: 'md' }} fs={{ md: 'sm', lg: 'base' }}> 
      Brimming with traditions as a community, we empower people and their potential
    </Text>
    <Text as="p" fs={{ md: 'sm', lg: 'base' }}>
      We build healthier, more vibrant communities with the belief that all things are possible our students grow into educated citizens, compassionate community members, critical thinkers and creative problem solvers.
    </Text>
  </Card>
</Canvas>

Research UI's breakpoints are mobile first: responsive props apply at that breakpoint and above. For example, the `lg` breakpoint is applied at screen sizes 960px and wider.

If the screen is smaller than all included breakpoints, then the value is `undefined` for that property.

Color properties (`c`, `bgc`) also follow a similar responsive object pattern to respond to theme changes to make color decisions based on the user's current theme:

```tsx
<Text as="p" c={{ light: 'gold', dark: 'teal' }}> 
  Brimming with traditions as a community, we empower people and their potential
</Text>
```

Toggle your theme to watch the text color change:

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>
  <Card withBorder>
    <Text as="p" c={{ light: 'violet', dark: 'teal' }}> 
      Brimming with traditions as a community, we empower people and their potential
    </Text>
  </Card>
</Canvas>
