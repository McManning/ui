// Sass styles specifically for rendering within react-styleguidst.

// In order to render out demo-able components in the styleguide, we need
// to import ORIS/UI prior to flow. When applications include flow, they
// will import oris/ui separately on their own, so we exclude this from flow.scss

// Set our assets source to one of the remote servers, so that
// they aren't served from Webpack's dev server.
